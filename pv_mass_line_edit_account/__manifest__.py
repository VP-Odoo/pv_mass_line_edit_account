Mass Line Edit for Accounting
=============================

This module allows you to quickly update multiple invoice or journal entry lines at once in Odoo Accounting.

Features:
---------
* **Master Toggle**: Add a *Select All Lines* checkbox at the top of the invoice/journal form to enable bulk selection.
* **Per-Line Control**: Each line gets an *Apply to All* toggle (boolean switch).
* **Mass Editing**: When you edit a field on one line with *Apply to All* enabled, the same change is automatically applied to all other selected lines in the same document.
* Works on both the *Invoice Lines* tab and the *Journal Items* tab.
* Prevents infinite loops with a safe propagation mechanism.

Benefits:
---------
* Save time by editing once and applying changes to multiple lines.
* Reduce human error by ensuring consistent values across invoices and journal entries.
